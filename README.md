# Todo API - tsoa

This repo contains a simple todo API with code to connect to a local Postgres DB using the tsoa framework.

## Installation

Clone this repository, then run the following command in its directory.

## Running the app

You will need a local Postgres server to run this app, which you can easily do by following the instructions [here](https://www.codecademy.com/article/installing-and-using-postgresql-locally).

Once you have the server up and running, run the following command to start your API server listening on port 3000:

```

Your API should be all set to go!
